                            <h5 class="text-center mb-4"><b>Welcome to The Goddard School®</b></h5>
                            <p>The early years are a very special time in your child’s development. Great changes occur in this relatively short period of time as children learn to communicate, increase their intellectual awareness, and make great physical strides. In recognition of the crucial importance of these years, The Goddard School® has created a program tailored to meet the needs of your child at each stage of development.</p>
                            <p>The Goddard School® philosophy is to provide an atmosphere suited to the development of self- esteem, confidence, and love of learning. By combining the best possible equipment and professionally educated staff in an environment specifically designed for young children, we offer an outstanding program.</p>
                            <p>The educational goal of The Goddard School® is to utilize fun and creativity to foster a love of learning. We challenge our students by promoting inquiry and discovery through exploring the world around them. This instills a sense of confidence in their ability to master new situations and tasks through reasoning. Your child will be exposed to a variety of teaching methods so that he/she will be able to meet success in any elementary school system.</p>
                            <p>You, the parents,* are very important to The Goddard staff because you know your child best. We encourage you to contact the school about any questions or concerns you might have. Please review the daily reports highlighting your child’s activities. If there is anything we can do to make your child’s experiences more meaningful, please let us know.</p>
                            <p>We are looking forward to working with you and your child and sharing in his/her growth and development.</p>
                            <p>Many thanks for choosing The Goddard School® located in Lynnwood, WA.</p>

                            <h5 class="text-center mb-4"><b>Mission Statement</b></h5>
                            <p>We are dedicated to giving children a love of learning in a safe and secure environment. Our teachers design their own lesson plans to help children learn and explore the world at their own pace.</p>
                            <p>Our teachers are loving, nurturing, trained professionals committed to maintaining the highest quality in early childhood education. Through onsite training provided by the Director, as well as Goddard University, our teachers receive ongoing training in order to learn the latest developments within the field of Early Childhood Education.</p>
                            <p>Our school is a safe, secure, clean, and happy environment for children to grow and learn. We will make the transition from home to school a positive experience.</p>
                            <p>Each child is treated as a unique individual. Each child is given individual attention within a group allowing him/her to progress according to his/her own needs and rate of development.</p>
                            <p>Communication with parents is the key. It is based upon being open, honest, and respectful - encouraging both involvement and support. Parents are informed daily of their child’s progress and development.</p>
                            <p>We strive to provide the best in childcare and development. We are committed to Goddard’s standards of excellence and are continually seeking to improve.</p>
                            <p>Our number one priority is providing every child with a loving and caring atmosphere conducive to the development of self-esteem, confidence, creativity, and a love of learning.</p>
                            <h5 class="text-center mb-4"><b>Children’s Bill of Rights</b></h5>
                            <p>We, the faculty, and staff of The Goddard School®, pledge to honor this Children’s Bill of Rights.</p>
                            <p>Every child in our program has the right to be respected as an individual with concern for his or her own interests, challenges, talents, and pace of learning.</p>
                            <p>Every child has the right to a calm, warm, loving, and nurturing environment where affection is freely given so that a child feels valued and secure and is thus able to develop self-confidence.</p>
                            <p>Every child has the right to personal attention, a relaxed atmosphere, and freedom of choice in daily activities that can only be provided in a small group setting.</p>
                            <p>Every child has the right to have all physical needs met, including the need for rest and relaxation throughout the day.</p>
                            <p>Every child has the right to a clean, safe environment in which to spend their day.</p>
                            <p>Every child has the right to experience a variety of activities throughout the day that help them develop a feeling of independence and confidence. These activities provide opportunities for creativity, exploration, and a lifelong love of learning.</p>

                            <h5 class="text-center mb-4"><b>General Information</b></h5>
                            <p>The Goddard School® located in Lynnwood, WA is part of a multi-state organization of specialized preschool centers founded in 1984. We are licensed by the State of Washington Department of Early Learning.<br><br>
                                The Goddard School® is open 12 months a year from 7:00 AM to 6:00 PM Monday through Friday. You will be asked to designate your child’s hours of attendance at the time of enrollment. Please note, Washington State mandates the maximum length of time a child can be in a childcare center at 10 hours per day. Our school policy follows the 10-hour maximum rule and will apply fees to ensure adherence to this rule. A school-closing schedule including holidays, parent- teacher conferences and teacher in-service days will be provided at the time of enrollment.</p>
                            <h5 class="text-center mb-4"><b>Enrollment Procedure - Class Placement</b></h5>
                            <p>Enrollment is open to any child six (6) weeks to six (6) years of age, provided The Goddard School® can meet his/her needs. Enrollment is granted without discrimination with regard to sex, race, color, religion, or political belief.<br><br>
                                Interested families are invited to tour the center, meet the staff, review, and complete all paperwork prior to enrollment. Upon receipt of the completed application and registration fee, placement will occur on a first-come, first-serve basis. Prior to a child’s attendance, a school visit with the parent and child is requested to acquaint each new family with the environment, staff, and schedule for the child. Children are grouped by both age and developmental abilities.</p>
                            <h5 class="text-center mb-4"><b>Student Records</b></h5>
                            <p>Each child enrolled in The Goddard School® must have an updated school record with all Washington State and Goddard required forms. This file is confidential, and will be shared with staff members only, as required to meet the needs of the child.<br><br>
                            Emergency contact information must be reviewed by the parent at least once per calendar year at or before the time the annual enrollment agreement is signed to ensure accuracy. Medical records are required to be updated annually, or whenever the child’s immunization status changes.<br><br>
                                Upon graduation or withdrawal of a child, a copy of your child’s complete file may be requested in writing. School Districts requests for documents will require written permission for release by the parent.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="row m-1 mb-4">
                            <h5 class="text-center mb-4"><b>Statement Of Confidentiality</b></h5>
                            <p>As a professional organization you can be assured all information regarding your family’s needs, file contents and handling, medical information, and conversations, will be handled with the appropriate confidentiality. Information will be shared only with those people requiring the knowledge to better serve your family.</p>
                            <h5 class="text-center mb-4"><b>Non-Discrimination</b></h5>
                            <p>The Goddard School® located in Lynnwood, WA will not discriminate against students, parents, or staff. We believe that our students have the right to learn and play in an environment that is free from all forms of discrimination. Consistent with applicable laws and The Goddard School’s philosophy, we make all decisions involving enrollment at The Goddard School® without regard to race, creed, religion, color, age, sex, national origin, citizenship, disability, or any other characteristic protected under local, state, or federal law. You are encouraged to raise any questions regarding your equal opportunity at The Goddard School.</p>
                            <h5 class="text-center mb-4"><b>Attendance</b></h5>
                            <p>A parent should notify The Goddard School® by 9:00 AM by calling 425-510-7055 whenever a child is late or will not be attending on a scheduled day. Teachers attempt to wait until everyone has arrived to begin circle time, so timely notification is appreciated. The school should be notified, as soon as possible, if a child is ill, which enables our staff to track any illness that may occur at the school.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="row m-1 mb-4">
                            <h5 class="text-center mb-4"><b>Parent Access</b></h5>
                            <p>A parent of a child enrolled in The Goddard School®, shall be permitted free access, without prior notice, throughout the school whenever the child is in attendance. In cases where the Family Court or other legal entities have established visitation or custody rights, a copy of the orders must be provided to The Goddard School®. The orders of the court will be strictly followed unless the custodial parent requests a more liberal variation of the court order, which must be in writing. Visitors when accompanied by a student’s parent are asked to schedule appointments and are allowed in the childcare areas only at the discretion of the Director and/or Owner. Visitors will be accompanied by a staff member at all times.</p>
                            <h5 class="text-center mb-4"><b>Parking and Speed Limit</b></h5>
                            <p>The speed limit through the parking area is 5 mph. Parent parking is in front of the building. Parents should not park in the fire lane, as this is reserved for emergency vehicles. Handicap spaces, by Washington State law, must be reserved for vehicles displaying an approved handicap placard. It is unlawful to park in a handicapped designated parking space without a state issued placard. For the safety of all, children must be accompanied by a parent into the building, using the front door. Children should be held by the hand when walking to or from the building while in the parking lot.</p>
                            <p>Please do not leave any child in your vehicle unattended when dropping off or picking up siblings. Doing so is unsafe and should never happen per RCW 10.52.215.</p>
                            <h5 class="text-center mb-4"><b>Arrival and Departure</b></h5>
                            <p>Upon arrival each morning, children must be signed in using the electronic devices in the foyer. Children are to be escorted to their designated classroom area and delivered to the supervising staff member. Children are required by law to be under adult supervision at all times. Do not leave any child in a classroom, playground, or common area unattended at any time. Parental involvement will help the child settle quickly into the morning routine. The staff will do anything that they can to assist in a smooth transition. The Goddard School® discourages parents from “sneaking out” of the school.<br><br>
                                Children attending our program should be settled and ready to begin no later than 10:00 AM. Late arrivals may make a child feel left out since their classmates will already be involved in the day’s activities. Late arrivals also cause a disruption to the other children already in attendance. All late arrivals require preapproval from the administrative staff. We reserve the right not to accept late arrivals without proper notification.<br><br>
                                When picking up individual children at the end of the day, parents must sign their children out on the appropriate electronic device in the foyer. Attendance is reviewed by Washington State licensing personnel and is used to determine staffing requirements.<br><br>
                                At pickup/drop off times, please ensure that you are with your child at all times on school property. For example, running through the hallway, parking lots, adult bathrooms, etc. will not be allowed. Once a child is removed from the supervising staff member it becomes the responsibility of the person picking up your child to provide supervision. We advise all parents and guardians to guide your child by hand while in the parking lot for the safety of all.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="row m-1 mb-4">
                            <h5 class="text-center mb-4"><b>Release of Children</b></h5>
                            <p>Since the safety of the children is our utmost concern, The Goddard School® maintains a strict policy regarding the individuals to whom we will release a child. The enrollment forms require a parent to specify at least two (2) individuals to whom the child may be released on an on-going or emergency basis. In addition, parents are asked to specify a password for the release of the child.</p>
                            <p>Advance written notice is required for an individual to be authorized to pick up a child. In the case of an emergency, the Director or Owner may be notified by phone as to the name, address, phone number, and brief description of the person picking up the child. The Director or Owner will then call the parent back to verify the authorization. Once this individual arrives at the school, a staff member will verify the individual’s identity by reviewing two forms of identification and the password before the child is released. After confirmation of identity, The Director or Owner will go pick up the child from their designated classroom. The child must still be signed out.</p>
                            <p>If a non-custodial parent is not included among those persons authorized by the custodial parent to pick up the child, please inform the Director or Owner. A copy of the appropriate documentation regarding visitation must be included in the child’s school record. This information will remain confidential and will be shared with staff as required, to meet the needs of the child.</p>
                             <p>Should an unauthorized individual arrive to pick up a child, a parent or emergency contact will be immediately notified by phone. If the Director is unable to contact a parent or emergency contact, the child will not be released. Should an unauthorized person become uncooperative with the school’s policy regarding the release of the child, the local authorities will be notified.</p>
                             <p>The Goddard School® will not release a child to any parent, relative, or other authorized adult who appears to be impaired by the use of drugs or alcohol. In the event this situation occurs, a phone call will be made to the parent, emergency contact person, and/or local authorities.</p>
                        </div>

                            <h5 class="text-center mb-4"><b>Registration Fee</b></h5>
                            <p>A non-refundable registration fee is payable upon enrollment, and due annually when the child is re-enrolled for each new school year.</p>
                            <h5 class="text-center mb-4"><b>Tuition Payments and Fees</b></h5>
                            <p>Tuition is paid on a monthly basis. Monthly tuition is due on or before the first of each month. A payment box is located outside the office. There will be a service fee of $100 for each check returned by the bank. This fee is due at the time of notification. We offer ACH in order to streamline the process for you, please see the office for paperwork. ACH runs on the 1st of every month. Any tuition that is not paid by the close of business on the first day of each month will incur a $100 late fee. Additional notice will then be given to the parent. After the fifteenth (15th) day, the child may not return to the program until the full tuition and late fee charges incurred are paid in full. All unpaid accounts must be rectified immediately or be subject to third party remediation. Please contact the owner if payment difficulties are anticipated so alternative arrangements can be made.</p>
                            <p>Monthly tuition fees are non-refundable regardless of holidays, vacation, inclement weather days or School closures resulting from causes beyond the reasonable control of the School or its management including, but not limited to fire, floods, civil commotions, strikes, lockouts or other labor disturbances, “Acts of God” or acts, omissions, or delays in acting by any governmental authority. The School and its management will use reasonable efforts to avoid unscheduled closures and will resume operation as soon as feasible. The School will make reasonable efforts to open in inclement weather; however, the School may choose to close at the discretion of the School’s owner. Parents will be notified of any school closures via electronic communication.</p>
                            <p>Monthly tuition fees are non-refundable regardless of illness, pandemics, Covid19, public health crises, government order, closures mandated by Washington State Department of Health and/or King County Department of Health, closures mandated by Department of Child, Youth and Families. Parents will be notified of any school closures via electronic communication.</p>
                            <p>The School will open at 7:00am and close at 6:00pm, however modified school hours may apply in case of any unforeseen circumstances. A fee will be charged for any child not picked up before the School’s regular closing time. Full day student late fees begin at 6:01pm. Half day student late fees begin at 12:01pm. This charge shall be $35 per child for the first 5 minutes and an additional $5 per child per 1 minute period thereafter. Fees for late pick-up are added to tuition; if not paid, the child will not be readmitted to the program. Consistent lateness will be cause for the child’s dismissal from the School. We will provide a written notice for the first infraction prior to applying a late fee. If a parent or guardian has not contacted us by 6:00 PM, we are required to inform the proper authorities. Two staff members are required to stay with your child until you arrive.</p>

                            <p>In the event Parents engage employees of the School from time to time for outside childcare services (“Outside Engagements”), Parents agree that Outside Engagements are not related to the School, its Owner or Goddard Systems, Inc. With respect to Outside Engagements, Parents release and discharge the School, its Owner and the franchisor of Goddard Schools, Goddard Systems, Inc., a Pennsylvania corporation, and their present or former officers, employees, shareholders, directors, affiliates, heirs, successors and assigns, in their individual and corporate capacities (the “Owner Releases”), from all claims, demands, liabilities, actions or causes of action whatsoever, whether known or unknown, which Parents have, may have or claim to have at any time in the future against the Owner Releases based in whole or in part on or arising out of or related to any Outside Engagements.</p>
                            <h5 class="text-center mb-4"><b>Additional Days/Hours</b></h5>
                            <p>Switching of scheduled days is not allowed. Additional days may be added based on the rates quoted in the enrollment agreement. Parents are required to let the Director or Owner know at least 48 hours in advance if planning to bring a child for an additional day. Additional days are offered based on current enrollment and may not always be available.</p>

                            <h5 class="text-center mb-4"><b>Health Policies</b></h5>
                            <p>The owners and staff at The Goddard School® do all we can to promote a healthy environment for your children. Our teachers make sure children wash their hands when arriving at school, before meals, after art projects, after toileting and diapering, after coming in from outside, and after wiping one’s nose. Our teachers are required to wash their hands before serving meals or snacks and always wear latex gloves while diapering or assisting a child with toileting and when coming into contact with any bodily fluids. In addition, we disinfect infant and toddler toys on a daily basis. Our preschool toys are disinfected weekly.</p>
                            <p>The health of the children is very important to the staff at The Goddard School®. Children who are ill cannot be appropriately cared for in a childcare setting. A child who is unable to participate due to illness should not be in attendance. The Goddard School® staff understands that it may be difficult to make alternate arrangements when a child may be too ill to attend the program. However, cooperation in keeping a child home when they are showing symptoms of illness will be greatly appreciated by the teachers and the children who would normally be in contact with that child. By establishing and maintaining a healthy environment and reasonable health policies, all of our children and families will benefit. Please help us in keeping everyone healthy by assisting with washing your child’s hands upon arrival at school (Per WA Licensing Requirements).</p>
                            <p>If a child does arrive in the morning showing signs of ill health, we will be unable to accept him/her. The exception to this requirement would be that a licensed physician has examined the child and indicated, in writing, that there would be no health risk to your child or others, and the child is capable of participating in all activities, including outdoor play.</p>
                            <p>Fever is an indication that the body is fighting something, and we need to be sure that children are not attending school who have been medicated to reduce the fever. Children continue to be contagious even when a fever is controlled by a fever reducing medication.</p>
                            <p>Examples of health symptoms that require exclusion from the program include, but are not limited to:</p>
                            <ul class="p-5 pt-0 mb-0">
                                <li>Severe pain or discomfort particularly in joints, abdomen, or ears</li>
                                <li>Vomiting (2 or more incidents within a 24-hour period)</li>

                                <li>Blood/pus from ears, skin, urine, stool</li>
                                <li>Unusual behavior characterized by listlessness, loss of normal appetite, or confusion</li>
                                <li>Symptoms of chicken pox, impetigo, lice, scabies, or strep throat</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>If a child becomes ill during the day, a parent will be advised immediately. The child will be given the opportunity to rest or do other activities in a separate, supervised area until a designated release person can pick up the child. If the child is not picked up within one hour from the time of notification, the emergency contact person will be called. Children who are sent home due to illness will not be readmitted to school until all signs of illness have been gone for 24 hours. Therefore, a child who is sent home ill cannot return to school the following day.
                                The exception to this requirement would be that a licensed physician has examined the child and has indicated in writing that the child does not present a health threat to him/her or others and is able to participate in all school activities, including outdoor play.

                            <p>In cases of certain communicable diseases, The Goddard School® is required to file a report with the Department of Health within 24 hours, so control measures can be used. Parents and staff are reminded to notify The Goddard School® within 24 hours if a child or family member has developed a known or suspected communicable disease. If a child has not been fully immunized for these diseases (due to the child’s age, medical condition, or religious belief) they will be excluded from the school during the outbreak of a vaccine-preventable disease, as directed by Washington State Department of Health.</p>
                            <p>All parents will be informed in writing if a communicable disease is reported. The Goddard School® follows the reporting guidelines as established by the Washington State Department of Health. A copy of the health policy is on file in the Director’s office and is available for your review.</p>    
                            <h6><b>“No Nit” Policy</b></h6>
                            <p>The Goddard School has determined the best way to prevent head lice is to institute a “no nit” policy at our school. We will periodically check the children in our school for head lice. If a child is found to have head lice, they will need to be picked up immediately. Before returning to class, the child should be brought to the office to be checked for nits. Once the child is determined to be free of nits, they may rejoin their class.</p>

                            <h5 class="text-center mb-4"><b>Medication Procedures</b></h5>
                            <h6><b>General Information on Medications</b></h6>
                            <p>The Goddard School in Lynnwood administers only life-saving medication such as EPI-Pen’s, Benadryl, Inhalers, etc.<br><br>
                                The medication logs and authorization forms are located in the Director’s office. Authorization forms must be completed by the parent or guardian and given to the Director prior to any medication being administered. This will serve as a second method to ensure that your child receives his/her medication.<br><br>
                                Check expiration dates on all medications. We will not be able to administer expired medications even if the log and form are completed.<br><br>
                                Every medication needs to have a pharmacy label with the child’s first and last name printed on the bottle. Only one bottle may be used for each child. Siblings may not share containers of medication.<br><br>
                                Over-the-counter medications will not be given even with a doctor’s note.</p>
                            <h6><b>Request for Medication to be Dispensed</b></h6>
                            <p>No over-the-counter medication will be dispensed. All medication must be a prescription prescribed by doctor and have a pharmacy label and medication number. When a child needs medication, 2 forms must be completed. The first form is the medication log. The log needs to be completed each day the child is to receive medication. A parent must indicate a specific time and dosage of medication to be dispensed. Medication will not be dispensed on an “as needed” basis. The second form is the authorization for dispensing medication. Medication will only be dispensed for the dates indicated on the form. The authorization form should be given directly to the Director.</p>
                            <h6><b>Allergies That May Require Medication</b></h6>
                            <p>If a child requires over-the-counter diaper ointments, lotions, lip balm, or sunscreen, these must be labeled with the child’s first and last name. The parent must complete an authorization form for each type of ointment or lotion. This authorization is good for one year. If diaper ointments are applied, it will be noted on the child’s daily report. These ointments and lotions must be placed in a designated container in the teacher closet or cabinet and remain at school overnight.</p>
                            <h6><b>Topical Medications (Diaper Creams, Sun Screens, Etc.)</b></h6>
                            <p>If a child requires over-the-counter diaper ointments, lotions, lip balm, or sun screen, these must be labeled with the child’s first and last name. The parent must complete an authorization form for each type of ointment or lotion. This authorization is good for one year. If diaper ointment s are applied it will be noted on the child’s daily report. These ointments and lotions must be placed in a designated container in the teacher closet or cabinet and remain at school overnight.</p>
                            <h5 class="text-center mb-4"><b>Accidents and Injury</b></h5>
                            <p>Should a child become injured at school, the parent will be notified via an accident report form. In the event of an injury above the shoulders, an email notification or phone call will be made. The parents will be asked to sign this form indicating that they have been notified, and a copy of the form will be included in the child’s school record. If the injury is of a serious nature, a parent will receive a phone call from the school at the time the accident occurs.</p>
                            <p>In the event of an emergency, the child will be transported via ambulance to the nearest hospital or emergency room facility and a parent will be contacted to meet an accompanying staff member at the facility. It is extremely important that emergency contact information for your child is up to date. A child cannot be transported for care, or receive any emergency care at school, unless the waivers for emergency care have been signed. These waivers are included in the enrollment packet.</p>
                          </div>
                        <div class="row m-1 mb-4">
                            <h5 class="text-center mb-4"><b>Toys From Home</b></h5>
                            <p>It is recommended that all personal toys remain at home. It is very difficult for young children to share favorite possessions, and all toys that enter the school must be shared. In addition, many toys break easily and contain small parts. These types of toys may be inappropriate for our setting.</p>
                            <p>Show and tell items may occasionally be requested by a child’s teacher. Suggested show and tell items include books, photographs, special treasures such as seashells, or theme related items.
                                These should be discussed with the teacher and items will be shown at the teacher’s discretion. Anything pertaining to violence (guns, war toys, etc.) or having anything to do with religious beliefs cannot be utilized at The Goddard School®. Material deemed inappropriate for a preschool audience will not be used. All electronic devices from home are not permitted at school.
                                </p>
                            <h5 class="text-center mb-4"><b>Items to Bring to School</b></h5>
                            <h6><b>Infants</b></h6>
                            <p>Each infant is provided with their own crib and mattress upon enrollment. The parent must provide:</p>
                            <ul class="p-5 pt-0 mb-0">
                                <li>2-3 crib sheets (port-a-crib or play yard size)</li>
                                <li>A sleep sac when appropriate</li>
                                <li>2-3 complete changes of clothing for the appropriate season</li>
                                <li>Diapers and wipes, diaper cream if needed</li>
                                <li>All food, drink, and utensils required to serve food</li>
                                <li>Sweater or sweatshirt, mittens and hat</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Parents are responsible for washing the crib linens at least once a week. Diaper creams and lotions are considered medication and therefore must be accompanied by Goddard’s authorization form. All food, bottles, and clothing must be labeled with the child’s first and last name. Bottles and caps will need to be re-labeled frequently. Any items required for serving food such as spoons, bowls, cups, etc. must also be provided and labeled by the parent. Bottles must be filled at home and brought to school ready to serve. We ask that you not send anything in glass jars or bottles. Refrigeration is provided for storing bottles and food.</p>
                            <h6><b>Toddlers, Preschoolers, and Pre-Kindergarten</b></h6>
                            <p>The parent must provide the following items for each toddler and/or preschooler:</p>
                            <ul class="p-5 pt-0 mb-0">
                                <li>Two full changes of clothing including socks and shoes</li>
                                <li>Meals must be provided daily in a labeled lunch box</li>
                                <li>Diapers and wipes, and/or extra sets of underwear if child is “in training”</li>
                                <li>A small blanket and sheet is requested for nap time and a favorite sleep toy may alsobe provided</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>All items brought to school should be conspicuously labeled with the child’s first and last name. Extra clothing should be provided as seasons change and as the child grows. Rubber soled, closed-toe shoes, such as sneakers, are the most appropriate shoes for daily activities, such as climbing, running, and playing outside. Appropriate outdoor apparel is needed daily, as every effort is made to have some outdoor play time, even in the winter months. Please label detachable clothing where possible (hoods on coats, clips on mittens); this will lessen missing items. Additional sets of clothing and appropriate underwear will be required when the child is “potty- training.” Blankets are sent home weekly to be laundered.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="row m-1 mb-4">
                            <h5 class="text-center mb-4"><b>Rest Time</b></h5>
                            <p>Children in the Toddler and Preschool classes are required to lie quietly on their sleeping mats for approximately 30 – 45 minutes daily. This allows those children who do wish to sleep a quiet length of time in which they may rest. Quiet music is played, the lights are dimmed, and it is a period of relaxation for both nappers and non-nappers. Those children who do not fall asleep during the initial quiet time are given the opportunity to select quiet activities such as books or puzzles to occupy themselves while their classmates rest. The Pre-Kindergarten classrooms are non-napping classes.</p>
                            <p>Although we make every effort to meet each child’s rest needs, it is difficult to guarantee a specific length of nap time, or wake-up time, as a child’s rest needs vary with activity level, sleep patterns the night before, etc. It is equally difficult, and in opposition to our child-centered program, to keep a child awake if he/she wants to rest.</p>
                            <p>Infants will rest on an individual schedule of time and length. Infants who cannot turn over on their own will be placed in the crib lying on their backs only unless a medical reason supported by a written physician’s note states otherwise.</p>
                            <h5 class="text-center mb-4"><b>Meals and Snacks</b></h5>
                            <p>The Goddard School® has found that parents prefer to provide lunch for their children. This way a parent can send a meal that meets their child’s individual needs and preferences. Children enrolled in the morning preschool program are encouraged to join their classmates for lunch and socialization. After lunch there is a natural break in the day for the morning children to depart, as the full day children prepare for rest time.</p>
                            <p>The Goddard School® provides morning and afternoon snacks on a daily basis. These may include items such as crackers, Cheerios, pretzels, and graham crackers. Fresh fruits and vegetables will also be served on a weekly basis. Beverages may include water, milk or 100% fruit juice. The snack menu is posted in the kitchen and emailed out to parents at the beginning of each month.</p>
                            <p>Parents of infants must send prepared bottles of breast milk or formula that is clearly labeled with the child’s first and last name, contents, and date. Arrangements may be made for mothers who wish to come to the school to breast feed their infant. Instructions regarding a feeding schedule that has been established by the parents must be provided, and these schedules should be updated as necessary when new foods are introduced. Infant bottles will be reheated in a bottle warmer, shaken, and temperature tested before feeding. Any contents remaining in a bottle after a feeding will be discarded after 45minutes for breastmilk and 1 hour for formula, therefore it is suggested that bottles be filled with the amount the child will drink at each feeding. Small (4oz.) bottles may be more appropriate for a young infant.</p>
                            <p>As solid foods are introduced, parents are requested to bring labeled containers or small containers of food. For the safety and protection of all our infants, no glass jars are allowed. Please send only plastic containers. All food should be portioned out in clean and sanitized containers. The date should also appear on the label, along with the child’s first and last name. All Infant food should be placed in the refrigerator in the individual box upon arrival. In warm weather, it is recommended that perishable food be transported in an insulated cooler. Any food or beverage not eaten at scheduled mealtimes must be discarded and noted in the child’s daily report. In the case of extra bottles/food for infants, any item that has not been opened will be saved until the end of the day. These bottles and/or food must be taken home at the end of each day.</p>
                            <p>Breakfast from home may be provided for children who arrive prior to 8:00 AM. All food should be sent ready to serve. If any preparation is required, parents should plan to spend several minutes assisting their children, as the staff will be supervising both eating and play time.
                                Children who arrive after 8:00 AM should eat breakfast at home, as school activities at this point in the day do not allow for the supervision of children who are eating breakfast. A mid-morning snack is served between 9:00 AM and 10:00 AM daily.
                            </p>
                            <p>For lunch, sandwiches, yogurt, soup, fruit, crackers, cheese, etc. are recommended so that the children receive a serving from each food group. Please try to avoid foods that contain excessive amounts of sugar, preservatives, artificial flavorings, colors, or caffeine. Lunches should be ready to serve (fruit peeled, soup in a microwave-safe container, etc.). Items that require refrigeration must be labeled with the child’s first and last name and placed in the appropriate tray in the classroom. The trays will then be placed in the refrigerator in the kitchen.</p>
                            <p>All bibs, bottles, cups, bowls, spoons, etc., must be taken home daily. Washington State Department of Health requirements do not allow us to wash and store these items. All items must be labeled with first and last names (no initials).</p>
                            <p>Your child will be encouraged to eat the balanced meal that you have provided. However, if a child refuses certain foods, those choices will be respected and will remain in the child’s lunch box if unopened. Please review your child’s daily report for an indication of appetite and food consumption. We are unable to save open food, our teachers do take a picture of their lunch after they are completed so that you can see what was eaten.</p>

                            <h5 class="text-center mb-4"><b>Transition</b></h5>
                            <p>Children grow so fast and before you know, they are ready to move to the next classroom. The Goddard School® staff is trained to transfer the trust your child has in his/her current teachers and classrooms, on to the next. Prior to any transition, you will be notified in writing of your child’s successes and the need to graduate to the next level. When transitions take place, particularly in summer and fall, your child will likely be in the same class for approximately 9 months if they are Get Set, Toddler, Pre-Toddler or First Steps. Preschool and Prekindergarten classes are typically a full year. Periodically there will be a change that takes place in those classes, based on the needs of the building and you will be notified through a transition letter if that takes place. You are welcome to schedule a conference with either your current teacher(s) or the next classroom’s staff to discuss your child’s needs. The letter will inform you of how a transition works and how you can lend us a hand in making the experience a successful one. As children transition, their attendance is tracked in both classrooms to assure adult supervision.</p>
                            <h5 class="text-center mb-4"><b>Toilet Training Philosophy</b></h5>
                            <p>Toilet training is one of the many developmental skills children acquire between the ages of 2½ and 3. As a developmental skill, it will be reached in a child’s own time.</p>
                            <p>The Goddard School’s® “Get Set” program has been designed and scheduled to provide ample opportunities to foster this skill. While focus remains on this developmental milestone, academic activities for older 2’s and young 3’s are presented and reinforced daily. Children will not transition into the Preschool classroom until they are potty-trained and wearing underwear “not a pull-up” throughout the whole length of the day. Potty-training includes the ability to fully dress/undress themselves, proper wiping, communication of bathroom needs to teachers, and control during transitions of the day.</p>
                            <p>During this process, diapers should be replaced by training pants or pull-ups, and then by regular underwear. As accidents are inevitable, a sufficient supply should be on hand, along with season appropriate clothing changes.</p>
                            <h5 class="text-center mb-4"><b>Field Trips</b></h5>
                            <p>As part of The Goddard School® program, periodic walking field trips will be planned to provide the children with exposure to learning experiences in our local community. Prior to each trip, information will be sent home outlining the date, time, cost, location, chaperones, etc. A permission slip is required and must be signed by a parent and returned to the supervising teacher by the date requested on the form. No child will be permitted to attend a field trip if the required permission slip is not on file. Children must be four (4) years of age or older to participate in walking field trips. Ratios for field trips are 1 teacher/staff member or chaperone per 5 children.</p>
                            <h5 class="text-center mb-4"><b>Celebration of a Child’s Birthday</b></h5>
                            <p>The celebration of a child’s birthday at school with their friends can be a wonderful lifetime memory. In planning these moments, please consider the nutritional needs and requirements of all the children in the class. Special treats must be store purchased and arrive at the school in their original store container. Please provide the teacher with advance notice of what will be brought and coordinate the date and time with the teacher. We have a wonderful list of suggestions, please ask the Director or Owner for a copy.</p>
                            <p>Please contact the Director or Owner for assistance in any special event planning at the school.</p>
                            <h5 class="text-center mb-4"><b>Smoking</b></h5>
                            <p>It is our desire that the environment around the children be as safe and healthy as possible. Therefore, The Goddard School® is a smoke-free environment, both inside the building and on school grounds. Parents, faculty, staff, and visitors are asked to comply with this request.</p>

                            <p>The Goddard School® will make every effort to open on time and remain open in the event of inclement weather. However, in the case of extremely dangerous road conditions or states of emergency, it may be necessary for the school to cancel school or delay the opening time or early dismissal. We will send Kaymbu, Emails and Text Messages out as soon as possible. Should parents be prevented by weather conditions from reaching the facility to pick up their children, please make plans for an alternate pick-up. Closing staff members will care for the children and maintain proper staff-child ratio, until such time as the parents can safely reach the school.</p>
                            <p>Should the building require emergency evacuation, the staff-child ratios will be maintained, and the children will be evacuated to a nearby location. Each staff member responsible for a group of children will carry emergency contact information and class attendance records with them to the new site. Parents will be contacted by telephone as to the location of the children, or by radio broadcast if phone transmission is not possible, depending on circumstances, parents may be requested to pick up their children, or arrange for the emergency contact person to pick up their children.</p>

                            <h5 class="text-center mb-4"><b>Websites, Blogs and Security Issues</b></h5>
                            <p>Out of concern for child safety, we do not permit the use of The Goddard School name or service mark, including logos, photographs of school grounds, and photographs of any child, parent, or employee of the school, to be posted on a web site, blog, or online social network without written permission from The Goddard School. If you wish to share information about The Goddard School in this manner, please check with your on-site owner or school director. We also have a Social Media Policy if you would like a copy for your information.</p>
                            <h5 class="text-center mb-4"><b>Reporting of Suspected Child Abuse or Neglect</b></h5>
                            <p>Every school is required by law to notify state authorities if there is knowledge or suspicion of physical or sexual abuse of children in or outside of school. The Goddard School located in Lynnwood, WA complies with this law and cooperates with authorities in investigations.</p>
                            <h5 class="text-center mb-4"><b>Behavior Policy</b></h5>
                            <p>It is the policy of The Goddard School® to keep disciplinary issues minimized and to help children monitor their own behavior. The staff of The Goddard School® present and model age-appropriate behavioral guidelines and use reflective communication to encourage children to express their emotions. The staff encourages self-control, self-direction, responsibility, and cooperation. At this time practical and safe, logical, or natural consequences will be presented to the child.</p>
                            <p>The Goddard School® staff are trained in the process of positive discipline. Positive discipline instructs children as to what they should do. For example: “We walk inside the building” vs. “No running!” This philosophy of behavior is in accordance with The Goddard School® belief that children learn best in an environment where love, guidance, and encouragement promote the development of self-esteem.</p>
                            <p>“Quiet time” may be used selectively for children over 18 months of age who are at risk of harming themselves or others. “Quiet time” is used as a last resort after several attempts of redirection have been made. The period of “quiet time” will be just long enough to enable the child to regain control of him or herself and will never be longer than 1-2 minutes per year of age. During the “quiet time” period, the child will be in an area where they may be visually observed by a teacher/Director.</p>
                            <p>Aggressive physical behavior (fighting, hitting, biting, etc.) by a child toward another child or staff member is unacceptable. Staff members will intervene immediately should this type of situation occur, in order to protect all of the children and encourage more acceptable behavior. Physical restraint (a teacher holding a child) will not be used except as necessary to ensure a child’s safety or that of others, and then only for as long as is necessary for control of the situation. Children will be shown positive alternatives rather than just being told “no”. Parents will be informed if such an incident occurs, and a conference may be requested at any time to discuss an acceptable behavioral plan. If at the discretion of The Goddard School® staff, a child’s behavior is determined to be uncontrollable, extremely disruptive, and/or harmful to themselves or others, the parent will be called to come and remove the child from school for the day.<br>
                                Parents will be required to make arrangements for the child to be picked up within 45 minutes of the call. Failure to do so may result in termination of services. The Goddard School® reserves the right to terminate enrollment of children who exhibit behavioral patterns, which are deemed to be harmful to themselves or others. The determination of what is harmful and/or appropriate is at the sole discretion of The Goddard School® staff. Open communication between home and school is considered key to effective discipline.</p>
                            <p>At no time, at The Goddard School® will a child be subjected to physical corporal punishment (shaking, hitting, biting, pinching, etc.), humiliated, frightened, or verbally abused by our staff. Children will never be disciplined for sleep habits, toileting accidents, food consumption, or lack of participation in scheduled activities. At all times, a child’s age, emotional state, and past experiences will be considered in discipline matters. Any violation of the school’s discipline policy should be brought to the Director or Owner’s attention immediately.</p>

                            <h5 class="text-center mb-4"><b>Addressing Individual Child Concerns</b></h5>
                            <p>The Goddard School® has developed a strong working relationship with Kindering, an early intervention center serving urban East King County. Kindering is the largest intervention center in Washington, one of the three largest in the nation, and notably the most comprehensive. The Educational Consultants at Kindering are committed to providing superior, individualized, family-centered services for children throughout the Eastside.</p>
                            <p>Whenever there is a question about a child’s development or behavior, our first question is to ask if the environment can be modified to better accommodate the child’s needs. Kindering has been very helpful to our staff in making adjustments to our classrooms to better meet children’s needs. When the environmental changes are not enough, we then explore individual concerns. If the assessment process informs us of a specific need, the parents meet with the Educational Consultant, as well as the Director and classroom teachers. Our conversation is designed to build a strong partnership between home, school and outside services that may benefit the child.</p>
                            <p>Kindering can become a strong support for the family and provide referral services when appropriate. This is a free service, and we are appreciative of the input that Kindering provides and the support they give to our program.</p>
                            <h5 class="text-center mb-4"><b>Parent Code of Conduct</b></h5>
                            <p>The Goddard School® expects parents to observe a certain standard of conduct at the center and on its grounds. The following behaviors are not acceptable in the facility or on the grounds:</p>
                            <ul class="p-5 pt-0 mb-0">
                                <li>Physical or verbal punishment of their children</li>
                                <li>Physical or verbal punishment of other children</li>
                                <li>Threatening or intimidating staff, other parents, or other children</li>
                                <li>Swearing/cursing or threatening/obscene gestures</li>
                                <li>Quarreling with other parents or staff</li>
                                <li>Not following policies designated to protect the safety and security of everyone in the center.</li>
                                    
                            </ul>
                            <h5 class="text-center mb-4"><b>Parent Communication</b></h5>
                            <p>The Goddard School® provides many opportunities for parents to receive information on the progress of their children, as well as details on other general activities occurring from time to time at the school. Examples of the types of communication that parents will receive include:</p>
                            <h6><b>Kaymbu</b></h6>
                            <p>A written daily report for each child in The Goddard School® provides a parent with an overview of the activities in which the child participated, as well as information on meals, sleep, and toileting will be emailed to you via KAYMBU (you can also download the App).</p>
                            <h6><b>Parent Conferences</b></h6>
                            <p>At least twice a year, or more often by parent (or staff) request, a formal parent/teacher conference time is scheduled. Our school is closed for the two scheduled conference dates, sign ups occur for families with siblings first and then open to the remaining classmates. These meetings serve to summarize each child’s progress in detail. The parents will be given a written developmental report, which summarizes the teacher’s evaluation.</p>
                            <h6><b>Information Boards</b></h6>
                            <p>Boards are located outside each classroom or inside the classroom by the door for your convenience. Information is provided about upcoming school and community events, as well as miscellaneous points of interest. Individual classroom boards will contain lesson plans, class schedules, and staff hours. It is recommended that parents check the boards regularly for updates and new information.</p>
                            <h6><b>Daily Feedback</b></h6>
                            <p>Daily communication will occur between staff and parents in the morning and evening to provide updates on the children’s health, disposition, etc. A long dialogue may not be possible at the drop- off or pick-up time, as these are particularly busy times when staff are responsible for supervising all of the children in their care. If you have a concern, a special appointment is advised, or telephone conferences may be arranged.</p>
                            <h6><b>Newsletters and Monthly Calendars</b></h6>
                            <p>Monthly newsletters are emailed out to keep parents posted on all school activities. Monthly calendars will be available on or before the first of each month. These will be emailed out to all families a few days before the new month begins.</p>    
                        </div>

                            <h5 class="text-center mb-4"><b>A Final Word</b></h5>
                            <p>The Owner and/or Director reserve the right to deny, cancel, sever, suspend, or terminate the services of any child, without notice, for any reason, so long as the determination in not based on whole or part on the race, color, creed, religion, sexual preference, age, gender, national origin, or disability or any other protected characteristic of the child or the child’s parents. At all times we strive to provide quality care for all children. If that quality is diminished by one child, the Director and/or Owner may ask for the dismissal of that child for the well-being of the other children in the room. Any unused tuition will be refunded minus any outstanding charges.<br><br>
                                The Goddard School® will not release a child to any parent, relative, or other authorized adult who appears to be impaired. In the event this situation is suspected, a telephone call will be made to the other parent, emergency contact person, local authorities and the Washington State Department of Child Protective Services in Washington and notify them of our suspicions.<br><br>
                                In the event that child abuse is suspected, we are required by the State of Washington to report any and all instances of suspected child abuse or neglect. When a staff member has information or evidence of suspected child abuse, the Director and/or Owner will be informed, and the Department of Child Protective Services is contacted and given this information.<br><br>
                                The Goddard School® reserves the right to edit any of the information contained in this manual at any time, and the material contained herein should not be considered as sole determination of policy.<br><br>
                                If, after reviewing this parent’s handbook, there are any questions or comments regarding The Goddard School® and its policies, parents should feel free to speak with the Owner and/or Director.</p>

                            <p>Our primary concern is for the safety and welfare of the children attending The Goddard School® in Lynnwood, WA. Our Emergency Operations Plan provides for response to all types of emergencies. Depending on the circumstances of the emergency, we will use one of the following protective actions:</p>
                            <ul class="p-5 pt-0 mb-0">
                                <li>Immediate evacuation: Students are evacuated to a safe area on the grounds of the facility in the event of a fire, etc.</li>
                                <li>In-place sheltering: Sudden occurrences may dictate that taking cover inside the building is the best immediate response.</li>
                                <li>Evacuation: In certain emergency situations, total evacuation of the facility may become necessary. In this case, the children will be taken to a safe relocation facility. Parents will be contacted by telephone as to the location of the children, or by radio broadcast if phone transmission is not possible.</li>
                                <li>Modified Operation: This may include cancellation, postponement, or rescheduling of normal activities. These actions are normally taken in the event of a winter storm or facility problems that make it unsafe for students (such as utility disruptions). However, this action may be necessary in a variety of situations.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>In the event of a local or regional emergency, please tune into your local news and radio stations for updated announcements. You may also go to goddardschool.com and click on the Lynnwood, WA location for announcements relating to any of the emergency actions listed above.</p>
                            <p>We ask that you do not call the school during an emergency. This will keep the main telephone line free to make emergency calls and relay information. We will call you and let you know that we’ve taken one of these protective actions. We will also call you when we have resolved the situation, and it is safe for you to pick up your child(ren).</p>
                            <p>The Owner and/or Directors may provide an alternative phone number (i.e. cell phone number) to call in the event of an emergency via group email or posting on our school’s website.</p>
                            <p>Our emergency preparedness plan is reviewed on a semi-annual basis with all staff and is located in each classroom binder as well as in the Director and Owner offices.</p>
